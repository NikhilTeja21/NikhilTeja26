# Python-streamlit
- I developed a local host website using python-streamlit, which highlights the basic level interface of a local website. 
- I used each and every built-in which can make a website look cool and able to load data faster.

### Packages Required
- turtle      : Shows graphics and presentations of designs.
- Date        : Displays data and time.
- Streamlit   : To create containers, to handle the data (read, write and appped) and adding images and lottie file graphics.
- Requests    : Feedback at the end of website.
- Numpy       : Basic data handling and plotting graphs if needed for presentation of data.
- Pandas      : To access the spreadsheets and handling of different format of data.

### How to install python
- Step 1 — Downloading the Python Installer. (https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
- Step 2 — Running the Executable Installer. (Run as administrator)
- Step 3 — Adding Python to the Environment Variables.
- Step 4 — Verify the Python Installation in the command prompt. (python --version).

### How to install packages
- Step 1: Download PIP get-pip.py (https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)
- Launch a command prompt if it isn't already open.
- Run the following command to download the get-pip.py file:
      curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
- Type this command -- python -m pip install --upgrade pip
- Then install every package using this command 
      pip install *package_name*

### Using of built-in's
- Using containers we can create seperate section for each.
- We can also add document upload section and specify the types(eg .pdf .pptx .xlsx .docx .csv etc)
- We can add lottie animation files by dividing the container into different number of sections.
- By using (CSS) file we can change the background color and font style and size.
- By using (toml) we can create a feedback at the end of the website without showing any administer information.
- We can add toolbar and authentication.
