# Python-streamlit
- I developed a local host website using python-streamlit, which highlights the basic level interface of a local website. 
- I used each and every built-in which can make a website look cool and able to load data faster.

### Packages Required
- turtle      : Shows graphics and presentations of designs.
- Date        : Displays data and time.
- Streamlit   : To create containers, to handle the data (read, write and appped) and adding images and lottie file graphics.
- Requests    : Feedback at the end of website.
- Numpy       : Basic data handling and plotting graphs if needed for presentation of data.
- Pandas      : To access the spreadsheets and handling of different format of data.
